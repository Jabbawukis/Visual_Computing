    "# Synthetic Data Generation and Data Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will explore an exciting approach to tackling vision problems when labeled ground truth data is either unavailable or limited in quantity. We aim to conduct experiments with the benefits of full supervision, even under such challenging circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our specific focus will be on solving the problem of semantic segmentation, where we aim to accurately segment a target object in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our experiment, the target object is available as a 3D model and no labelled real-world training data is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "To still achieve our goal, we will follow a structured approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Synthetic Data Generation**: We will leverage the power of **BlenderProc**, a versatile tool, to create synthetic training data. This allows to generate labeled data without manual efford.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Augmentation**: To further increase the varity of the data during training, we will explore different data augmentation techniques. By augmenting our dataset, we can introduce variations and increase the robustness of the trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Building the Segmentation Network**: We will construct a state-of-the-art segmentation network called **U-NET**. This network architecture employs a pretrained **MobileNetV2** backbone, which provides a strong foundation for accurate segmentation. We will train the network with our generated data and we will also use the implemented data augmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT NOTE ON HAND-IN PROCESS**\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the saved notebook, please also hand in the maniuplated files `dataset_generator.py` and `quickstart.py`, as well as a ***sample from your generated dataset*** (one image and mask) and the `loss_plot.png` image (several versions, if you did several tests) and a ***brief interpretation of the results***. Everything can be handed in as one zip file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Besides this notebook the edited files are not saved in Colab persistently, so  remember to copy the intermediate results to your computer.**\n"
